# PD-RC
At present, we first simply upload and share the core code of the PD-RC algorithm, the core code is mainly added on the original VVC test platform (VTM-14.0), and the core code we add is mainly a rewrite of the function (static int xCalcHADs8x8_ISlice(const Pel *piOrg, const int iStrideOrg)), which can be viewed in the file 'PD-RC core code.txt'.
After completing all the work in the later stage, more files will be uploaded and shared.
